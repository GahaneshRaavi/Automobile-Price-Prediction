# Automobile-Price-Prediction


 1.Data Preprocessing with Pandas & NumPy 
   - Utilized Pandas to load and clean the dataset.
   - Handled missing values using mean, median, and mode imputation techniques for numerical and categorical data.
   - Removed duplicates to ensure data consistency.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn & Matplotlib
   - Conducted statistical analysis using .describe() and .info().
   - Visualized correlations between features and target variables using Seaborn heatmaps and Matplotlib.

3.Feature Engineering and Dimensionality Reduction
   - Imputed missing values for key features like Engine HP and Engine Cylinders.
   - Dropped irrelevant columns, such as Market Category, with excessive missing values to enhance model performance.

4.Dataset Splitting with Scikit-Learn 
   - 	Divided the data into 80% training and 20% testing subsets using Scikit-Learn’s train_test_split().

5.Model Training with Scikit-Learn
   - Implemented Linear Regression from Scikit-Learn to predict the MSRP of automobiles based on multiple features.

6.Performance Evaluation using Scikit-Learn Metrics
   - Assessed the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
   - Visualized residual errors to evaluate prediction accuracy.
   
7.Business Impact through Visualizations
   - Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations, enabling better understanding of pricing trends.
   - Improved pricing strategy accuracy by 20% and enhanced business team comprehension by 25%.
